Hype: Compositional Machine Learning and Hyperparameter Optimization
====================================================================

Hype is a proof-of-concept deep learning library, where you can perform optimization on compositional machine learning systems of many components, even when such components themselves internally perform optimization.

It is developed by [Atılım Güneş Baydin](http://www.cs.nuim.ie/~gunes/) and [Barak A. Pearlmutter](http://bcl.hamilton.ie/~barak/), at the [Brain and Computation Lab](http://www.bcl.hamilton.ie/), National University of Ireland Maynooth.

This work is supported by Science Foundation Ireland grant 09/IN.1/I2637.

Please visit the [project website](http://hypelib.github.io/Hype/) for documentation and tutorials.
