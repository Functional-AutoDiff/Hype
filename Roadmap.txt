- CUDA backend (DiffSharp)
- Example for Hamiltonian MCMC
- Probabilistic inference
- Convolutional neural networks (ideally with DiffSharp tensor)

- Improve code comments
- Add references to research papers where relevant

- Add ability to read and write MATLAB files (scipy.io loadmat, savemat)
- Add ability to read and write FSL nifti files for fMRI (PyMVPA2, SampleAttributes, fmri_dataset, poly_detrend, zscore)
- Add ability to read and write standard image/video formats (OpenCV, MATLAB)
- Better integration with graph libraries (box plots, bar graphs, confusion matrix plots, write to .png support)
